# An-implement-of-Deep-feed-forward-network

This is an assignment from my deep learning class. Through this class, we studied the basic feedforward NN, deep model, regularization method, mini-batch SGD method with momentum and Adam for adjusted learning rate. I updated my code after I studied new methods. Of course, we also studied CNN, RNN and some other stuff, but I only implement them by tensorflow or keras since they are too complex to code.

Here is my code considered L1 and L2 regularization, mini-batch SGD method with momentum and Adam. The data set I use is MNIST. And I only did binary classification to find out if it is number x or not.
